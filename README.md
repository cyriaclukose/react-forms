## React Form
 In form we have to handle the data when the input changes or while submitting the form. We can handle the above two scenarios using onChange and onSubmit events
 In HTML form the data is handled by DOM but in react the data is handled by the React Components. ie the form data is store in the react component state.
 Its done with the help of useState hook from 'react' package 

 onChange event we update the state
